				<h3>Step 1: Take your body measurements</h3>



				<p><b>Option 1:</b> Measure your body size with the online software at <a href="http://upcload.com" target="_blank">http://upcload.com</a> that accurately measures your sizes to 1.5cm</p>
				<p><b>Option 2:</b> Measure yourself with a tape measure (if you need guidance, please send us an email to get the video instructions).</p>
				<p>Once you are done, send us an email with your measurements to place your order. Currently we take orders by emails or in person if you live in one of our supported locations (see Contact us). Later on we will have this process automatically done through the web.</p>

			<div class="span6">



				<h3>Step 2: Fill out the questionaire with your personal styles and preferences</h2>



				<p>After receiving your email from step 1, we will contact you with a form or in person to get your personal styles and preferences. <b>You can tell the tailor any detail you want for your clothes, too, just as you would request from your local tailors.</b> For example, what color do you like? Do you like short or long sleeves? How about the pockets or collar? This is so that your outfit is specially made just for you. Although currently we only offer shirts, but please contact us if you need something else. We will work it out together.</p>

				<h3>Step 3: Check the designs recommended by the tailor</h3>



				<p>Even if you know your style, it never hurts to get advice from the experienced tailor who knows it better. After receiving your measurements and personal specifications, we work with the tailors to recommend the designs from which you can choose. You can then make your decision and let the tailor take care of the rest.</p>

				<h3>Step 4: Receive and pay if you like</h3>



				<p>We understand your concerns when it comes to online shopping. That is why we are offering the special "pay only if you like" policy. If you receive a shirt below your expectation, send back the shirt and give the tailor feedback. Your tailor will happily adjust and re-make the right shirt for you. Easy, trouble free, and no risk involves. </p>
